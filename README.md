Title: Car Services Website with Firebase Authentication and JWT Authorization

Description:
This project is a full-stack web application built using React, Node.js, MongoDB, and Express, offering car services to users. It incorporates Firebase for user authentication and JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authorization. The website allows authorized users to order services, delete services, and utilize a contact backend messaging service implemented with Formspree.

Features:

1.Firebase Authentication: Users can sign up, sign in, and sign out securely using Firebase Authentication. This ensures a smooth and secure authentication process.

2.JWT Authorization: Once authenticated, users are granted access to authorized functionalities through JSON Web Tokens. This includes the ability to order and delete services, ensuring proper access control and data security.

authorization user : samiul@gmail.com
password : samiuL1234

3.Car Services: Users can browse through available car services and place orders as per their requirements. The system is designed to handle service orders efficiently.

4.Contact Backend Messaging: The website incorporates a contact form backed by Formspree, allowing users to send messages or inquiries easily to the service provider.

5.React Frontend: The frontend is built using React, providing a responsive and dynamic user interface. It offers a seamless browsing experience across different devices.

6.Node.js and Express Backend: The backend is powered by Node.js and Express, providing robust server-side functionalities. It handles authentication, authorization, service orders, and other backend operations efficiently.

7.MongoDB Database: MongoDB is used as the database to store user information, service data, and other relevant details. It offers scalability and flexibility for managing various data types.

8.RESTful API: The backend exposes a RESTful API that the frontend interacts with to perform various tasks, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and facilitating future scalability and maintainability.

This project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for managing car services, ensuring user authentication, authorization, and seamless interaction with the service provider through secure messaging. It demonstrates the integration of modern technologies to build a robust and user-friendly web application.
